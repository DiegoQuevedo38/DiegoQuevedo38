- 👋 Hi, I’m @DiegoQuevedo38
- 👀 I’m interested in Software development in general, but I really like the Back-end
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, PhP and Python, but I already know a couple of technologies like Sequelize, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like Node.Js, Express.Js, React and Redux 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding projects and spaces to keep learning more about this amazingly exciting world of Coding <3
- 📫 You can reach me via email through: quevedodiego3008@gmail.com or via phone by: +34 623 996663
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm Gender Fluid, so you can call me by the pronouns you better like, won't be bothered in any way
- ⚡ Fun fact: The only food I haven't been able to like even a little are the Chickpeas, but everyone around me also hates them, so that makes me feel okay with it hahaha
